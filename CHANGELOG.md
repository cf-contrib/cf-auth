# Changelog

## [0.10.0](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-exchange/compare/v0.9.0...v0.10.0) (2026-10-03)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* the module's policy_file and policy_vars variables are gone; pass oidc_providers, profiles and defaults instead, with "com.cloudflare.api.account.${var.account_id}" in place of ${account_id} and the module's audience default in place of ${broker_url}.

### Features

* a provider may name the typ its tokens must have ([49a4374](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-exchange/commit/49a4374a18582b5a0cdac169aeb18675c919668e))
* the Terraform module takes the policy as variables, as cf-nix-cache's does ([45b8100](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-exchange/commit/45b8100a5e5180ff8b12ed261b8a28c33445e4cb))

## [0.9.0](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-exchange/compare/v0.8.0...v0.9.0) (2026-10-03)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* workflows pass the broker's URL as url, not broker-url, and a token exchange's requested_token_type and issued_token_type for R2 credentials are urn:cf-oidc-exchange:params:oauth:token-type:r2-credentials.
* log lines have level, event and the event's fields; the matched claims are in claims, and expires_on is expires_at.
* the Worker takes its policy from the CF_OIDC_EXCHANGE_API_POLICY variable, at most 5 KB, which the Terraform module binds; releases no longer have entry.js, and index.js is the main module. A bad policy is logged as its first problem. Unknown routes are a bare 404, and the wrong method a 405.
* policies are version 3, with claims as lists of claim sets; versions 1 and 2 are refused. The access_token subject token type and the repository parameter are gone from /oauth/token, which no longer answers 404.
* the Worker reads its Cloudflare token from CF_OIDC_EXCHANGE_API_CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN, and the Terraform module takes it as cloudflare_token_secret instead of broker_token_secret.
* an invalid policy, an unset account or a broker token that isn't a Secrets Store binding now fails every request with 500 misconfigured, /health/live and /health/ready included, with why logged, rather than only the API's routes.
* error bodies are { "error": code, "message": ... }, as in cf-nix-cache, and the internal code is internal_error. For a caller's own mistake the message says what was wrong; for a fault of the broker's it's generic, with why in the logs. Audit lines record error and message instead of reason and detail.
* GET /healthz is gone. GET /health/live answers 200 while the Worker serves; GET /health/ready answers 200, or 503 with no body when the policy or a secret is wrong or the check takes over 2s.
* the repository is cf-contrib/cf-oidc-exchange, so the action is uses: cf-contrib/cf-oidc-exchange@<version> and the Terraform module's source is .../cf-oidc-exchange.git//deployment/terraform. The Worker's bindings are CF_OIDC_EXCHANGE_API_ACCOUNT_ID, CF_OIDC_EXCHANGE_API_BROKER_TOKEN and CF_OIDC_EXCHANGE_API_SIGNING_KEY (the module sets them). The module's default worker_name is cf-oidc-exchange: set worker_name = "cf-auth" to keep an existing workers.dev hostname.
* the broker is the Rust Worker. Its token exchange and revocation take form-encoded bodies only, as RFC 8693 and RFC 7009 have it; JSON is refused with 400. The Terraform module moved from //packages/cf-oidc-broker/terraform to //deployment/terraform; broker_file is now worker_dir (a worker-build directory) and broker_sha256 is now checksums_sha256 (the SHA-256 of the release's SHA256SUMS). Releases no longer attach broker.js.

### Features

* cf-oidc-jwt, OIDC token verification for Workers ([4b549e7](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-exchange/commit/4b549e7fcbe7615a07f63feb76bb3b276024d6be))
* OIDC only, with cf-nix-cache's claim sets ([d7b0809](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-exchange/commit/d7b08097df1d568a11126cb92fa15d78c746585c))
* port the policy to Rust ([c341106](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-exchange/commit/c341106f482108c04db5ac70d22adafe12a3419c))
* release and deploy the Rust Worker, and remove the TypeScript broker ([9da105c](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-exchange/commit/9da105ccfa4bcc4214656752d4f60f910596236c))
* rename cf-oidc-auth to cf-oidc-exchange ([085f5d9](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-exchange/commit/085f5d9159c4dd1c3140715aca60af0df966fee5))
* the action's input is url, and R2 credentials' token type cf-oidc-exchange's ([bf33175](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-exchange/commit/bf331752364019088e1d87a3c93483f2476df87e))
* the broker's flows in the Rust Worker ([a847ab9](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-exchange/commit/a847ab959e3c327ae4f2a8d6d55a9d45debf2372))


### Code Refactoring

* health endpoints from the SDK, like grpc-rust-template ([d38fdbd](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-exchange/commit/d38fdbde6aa9b96b13aab4b18e7321fd7624ee3b))
* lay the Worker out as cf-nix-cache-api's ([3e816b1](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-exchange/commit/3e816b1bf8774c16ea95990c39c8e8f2ba266ecf))
* log with tracing, as JSON lines ([96ee8c0](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-exchange/commit/96ee8c06ab4692a782e0db6fa082324b68a89e18))
* name the broker token the Cloudflare token, and keep the policy in the config ([c9380eb](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-exchange/commit/c9380eb29207ccd41789212f2a3964b2e1d690b3))
* read the bindings into a Config, as cf-nix-cache does ([c3ede99](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-exchange/commit/c3ede993b8e9406feca3f6fccc682388b2e2fa2e))
* the handler as cf-nix-cache's, with the spec's errors ([3f97217](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-exchange/commit/3f9721744448570657067b3ae9c020b972bdc47a))

## [0.8.0](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-auth/compare/v0.7.0...v0.8.0) (2026-10-02)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* version 1 policies are refused. The github: block becomes a list of providers (name, issuer, audience, jwks_uri, claims) with a top-level issuer (the broker's URL); issuer https://github.com means people's GitHub tokens. github.owner_id becomes the provider's claims.repository_owner_id, subject: users a profile for the https://github.com provider, match: is renamed claims: and takes one value or a list, and token.ttl/token.max_ttl move to the profile. See the broker README's migration table.
* POST /v1/actions/token, /v1/users/token and /v1/revoke are removed. Get credentials with an RFC 8693 token exchange at POST /oauth/token and revoke them at POST /oauth/revoke (RFC 7009); the action from this release does. Deploy the broker and upgrade the action together.
* a match pattern may only end in one * after a prefix, such as example-org/*. A bare *, a leading one or one in the middle is refused when the policy loads ("* is only allowed once, at the end, after a prefix").

### Features

* broker-issued tokens for other services, with discovery and JWKS ([#37](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-auth/issues/37)) ([d0bf8f7](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-auth/commit/d0bf8f76234917b7740708999ae703976fbcc992))
* OAuth endpoints: token exchange at /oauth/token, revocation at /oauth/revoke ([bad9004](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-auth/commit/bad90041ebcb06e1b52ce77fc2f1d4120249c6da))
* policy version 2, with identity providers ([#39](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-auth/issues/39)) ([dacaebc](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-auth/commit/dacaebc2e68067c07a69ad537e50f7ce75384831))
* profiles can be switched off with enabled: false ([#35](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-auth/issues/35)) ([dcdfc0f](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-auth/commit/dcdfc0f90388672b50acba110f07e3b8f9798e88))
* stricter match wildcards, and enabled: false on profiles ([#35](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-auth/issues/35)) ([dcdfc0f](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-auth/commit/dcdfc0f90388672b50acba110f07e3b8f9798e88))

## [0.7.0](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-auth/compare/v0.6.0...v0.7.0) (2026-10-01)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* `subject: user`, released in 0.6.0, is now `subject: users`, so a profile's subject is also its route. A policy still using `user` fails to load with "subject: must be actions or users".

### Bug Fixes

* name the people subject users, like its route ([#31](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-auth/issues/31)) ([2323713](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-auth/commit/2323713bb47ef39b55344284f0d92ad63bb3317d))

* prefix-scoped R2 temporary credentials in profiles ([#23](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-auth/issues/23)) ([3d293fa](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-auth/commit/3d293fa1eb91473ea30535937fe7c59595ca00c5)), closes [#22](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-auth/issues/22)
* several buckets per profile, exported as AWS profiles ([#27](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-auth/issues/27)) ([82ec113](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-auth/commit/82ec113a87abed3cfd8143cc10db735d1037e21a)), closes [#26](https://github.com/cf-contrib/cf-oidc-auth/issues/26)

### Bug Fixes
